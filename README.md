# Advent of Code 2020 Solutions
https://adventofcode.com/2020

## Overview
I started the challenge last year with my development team and have these baseline "solutions" - quotes because some are rougher than others!  Some on the team got further than others, but basically we all fell short - and I was shorter than most. :)

With the new 2021 challenge beginning, I wanted to review 2020 and couldn't really find a repository of solutions. So this, is that. Happy to have anyone that wants to contribute.

## Details
We're building this out using VS Code, so please update the tasks.json and launch.json files to facilitate running your submissions.
